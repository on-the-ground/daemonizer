/** * Daemon is a utility class that manages an event loop processing events
 * from a bounded queue. It allows pushing events to the queue and handles them
 * asynchronously using a provided handler function.
 * It supports graceful shutdown and ensures that all events are processed before closing.
 *
 * @template E - The type of events to handle.
 * @param signal - An AbortSignal to allow cancellation of the event loop.
 * @param handleEvent - A function that processes each event. It should return a
 * Promise that resolves when the event is handled.
 * @param bufferSize - The size of the bounded queue buffer. Defaults to 10.
 * @param loopIntervalMs - Interval in milliseconds used for two purposes:
 *   (1) to periodically yield control to the JS event loop for fairness,
 *   (2) if `strictInterval` is enabled, to enforce a per-event processing timeout.
 *   Defaults to 8ms (roughly 60fps frame budget).
 * @param strictInterval - If true, each event handler must complete within
 *   `loopIntervalMs`, otherwise it is aborted. If false, handlers may take longer
 *   but yielding still happens at the interval. Defaults to false.
